## Enhanced Core: Changelog

### 0.6.0
Added:
* Horizontal tube stations. (You currently can't lie down in them and move - you have to use a mod like Morph and change to something small like the smallest slime to be able to use these for now.)
* Ability to move into one tube going a different direction than another.
* Multiple hit boxes for Tube Stations & Tubes, so you can interact with things outside of the block while standing inside.

Changed:
* You will need to destroy and place back down any Tube Stations you have
* You can now combine tubes together to create bigger tubes.
* Changed the colour of the tube depending on the direction it's facing.

### 0.5.0
* Initial Release
